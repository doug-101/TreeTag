August 27, 2023 - Release 0.7.0 (stable)

New Features:
- Created a new script for Linux installation. It uses the native
  packaging system to install dependencies, builds TreeTag and
  installs it.
- On desktop systems, a new interface can easily add local file links
  in Markdown text fields. Clicking on a link opens the default
  application for that file type.

Updates & Bug Fixes:
- See the CHANGELOG.md file for the full list of changes.
