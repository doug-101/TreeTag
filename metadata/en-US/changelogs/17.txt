November 9, 2024 - Release 0.8.0 (stable)

New Features:
- Added a field configuration option that allows multiple entries for a single
  field.  Nodes with multiple entries can show under multiple categories.
- In a group rule, the default child sort fields now exclude the fields used in
  upstream rules.
- Changed from a back button to separate accept & reject buttons on several
  views.

Updates:
- Tweaked the theme colors to make cards and tiles more visible.
- Made several code cleanup changes.
- Updated the movies sample to include multiple field entries.
- The Android build was updated to work with Android 15.
- Updated the versions of several libraries used to build TreeTag.

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed a problem with the search and replace function that could cause a loss
  of data.

Notes:
- Changes to support multiple field entries broke backward compatibility.  This
  version can open files from older versions, but older versions can not open
  files saved in this version.
