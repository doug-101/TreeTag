TreeTag is a personal data manager. It stores information in a hierarchy (the
"Tree" part of the name). But unlike other tree-based applications, TreeTag
automatically positions items in the tree based on field values (the "Tag" part
of the name).

The data items are generally configured to contain several fields. Different
types of fields are available, including text, numbers, dates, times and
predefined choices. The output format of each field can be defined for group
headings, for data item titles and for data item output.

The user configures the base portion of the tree, defining rules that will
group the data items into desired categories.  The same items can appear in
multiple locations, with sections of the tree structure using different fields
for grouping or sorting.  For example, data items can be arranged by a date
field in one section, by a name field sorted alphabetically in another, and by
a category field in another.  This allows the differently organized portions of
the tree to act much like predefined searches.
