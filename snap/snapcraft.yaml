description: |
  TreeTag is a personal data manager. It stores information in a hierarchy
  (the "Tree" part of the name). But unlike other tree-based applications,
  TreeTag automatically positions items in the tree based on field values (the
  "Tag" part of the name).

confinement: strict # use 'strict' (not 'devmode') once you have the right plugs and slots
base: core22 # the base snap is the execution environment for this snap
grade: stable # must be 'stable' (not 'devel') to release into candidate/stable channels
