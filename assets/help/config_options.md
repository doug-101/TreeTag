## Configure Options
---

The Options tab of the Configuration view shows an option to enable Markdown
text formatting.  If enabled, text entries with Markdown syntax will show
formatted text in the Tree and Detail Views.  Many guides to Markdown syntax
are available on the web.  TreeTag specifically supports the GitHub Flavored
Markdown version.  Clickable links to http and https addresses can be entered
with the link text enclosed in square brackets followed by the address in
parenthesis.

On desktop platforms, right-clicking on field text editors when Markdown is
enabled will show a command to add a file link.  This will show a file
select dialog box to select the link target.  Clicking on that link in the
formatted tree or detail views opens the default application for that file
type.  An option in the Options tab is used to toggle between absolute and
relative paths for new links.
