## Configure Options

The Options tab of the Configuration view shows only one option: to enable
Markdown text formatting.  If enabled, text entries with Markdown syntax will
show formatted text in the Tree and Detail Views.  Many guides to markdown
syntax are available on the web.  TreeTag specifically supports the GitHub
Flavored Markdown version.  Clickable links to http and https addresses can be
entered with the link text enclosed in square brackets followed by the address
in parenthesis.
