## Quick Start
---

TreeTag shows an empty file list when it first starts.  The "+" icon can be used
to create a new file that can be modified and re-configured.

But a new file, with its simple structure, is probably not the best way to learn
about and understand TreeTag.  There are two built-in sample files that are
better choices.  Select "Sample Files" from the hamburger (three lines) menu on
the left.  Then either a double tap/click or a long press/click will open a
listed file.

In the tree view, tapping/clicking on a title or grouping node (proceeded by
small triangles) will expand or collapse the node's children.  On a leaf node
(proceeded by a dot), it will toggle from showing just a title line to showing
multiple output lines.

A long press/click on any node will show details in a detail view.  The "+" icon
in the top bar can be used to create new leaf nodes.  If a leaf node is being
shown, the pencil icon will allow its data to be edited.

All leaf nodes are automatically placed into location(s) in the tree based on
their data and the configuration of the tree.  The "Edit Configuration" command
in the hamburger menu will show controls for setting up the leaf node data, how
they are arranged and how they are displayed.  Please refer to the sections
below for more information.
