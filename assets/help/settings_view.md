## Settings View

The settings view contains general customization options.  Options not
previously discussed include hiding dot files, enabling spell checks, tight
line spacing, a dark theme, remember window geometry and a view scale ratio.
File names that begin with a dot will not be shown if the hidden option is
enabled.  The red underline under misspelled English words is controlled by the
spell check setting (currently, no suggestions are shown for misspelled words
on desktop platforms). The tight line spacing option allows more lines to fit
on the screen - it is recommended when using a mouse, but may not leave enough
space for touch interfaces.  A darker theme can be enabled in place of the
default light theme.  The window size and position will be restored from the
previous session use if enabled.  The view scale ratio can be set to make the
content smaller or larger (useful for high-dpi displays).

On desktop platforms, there is also an option to set the working directory.
This is where all files in the main file list are stored.
