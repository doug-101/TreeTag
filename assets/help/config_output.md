## Configure Output
---

The Output tab of the Configuration view shows a title line followed by one or
more output lines.  The title line defines how a leaf node is shown as a single
line in the main tree view.  The output lines are combined to define how a leaf
node is shown when expanded in the main tree view and in the detail view.

Tapping/clicking a title or output line toggles its selection.  There are icons
above the lines to add a new output line ("+"), edit a line (pencil), delete an
output line (trashcan), or move an output line up or down.

Adding or editing a line shows the line editor.  Fields and text that are added
show up as oval chips for each segment of the line.  These chips can be edited,
deleted and moved to fully define the line.  Editing a field chip allows the
user to define a custom prefix and suffix, as well as a field format for
applicable field types.  If not explicitly set, these will use the field
defaults.  Once the line is not empty, the line editor can be exited by using
the left arrow at the top.
