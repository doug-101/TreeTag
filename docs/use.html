<a id="start"></a> <h2>Quick Start</h2>

<p>TreeTag shows an empty file list when it first starts.  The "+" icon can be
used to create a new file that can be modified and re-configured.</p>

<p>But a new file, with its simple structure, is probably not the best way to
learn about and understand TreeTag.  There are two built-in sample files that
are better choices.  Select "Sample Files" from the hamburger (three lines)
menu on the left.  Then either a double tap/click or a long press/click will
open a listed file.</p>

<p>In the tree view, tapping/clicking on a title or grouping node (proceeded
by small triangles) will expand or collapse the node's children.  On a leaf
node (proceeded by a dot), it will toggle from showing just a title line to
showing multiple output lines.</p>

<p>A long press/click on any node will show details in a detail view.  The "+"
icon in the top bar can be used to create new leaf nodes.  If a leaf node is
being shown, the pencil icon will allow its data to be edited.</p>

<p>All leaf nodes are automatically placed into location(s) in the tree based
on their data and the configuration of the tree.  The "Edit Configuration"
command in the hamburger menu will show controls for setting up the leaf node
data, how they are arranged and how they are displayed.  Please refer to the
sections below for more information.</p>

<a id="files"></a> <h2>Files</h2>

<p>When TreeTag opens, it shows a list of files in the app's private storage
folder.  It will be empty the first time the app is run.  A tap/click on a
file name will select the file.  A double tap/click or a long press/click will
open the file.</p>

<p>In addition to opening TreeTag files (with a .trtg file extension), it can
also import files from TreeLine (with a .trln file extension).  Double or long
tapping/clicking on these files will show a prompt to select a single node
type to be imported. Imports should only be done from basic TreeLine files -
formatting and complex field types are not currently supported.</p>

<p>If a file to be opened is not a TreeTag or a TreeLine file, it will try to
import it as a CSV table.  The first row becomes the field names, and every
subsequent row becomes a leaf node.  The file will have a simple tree
structure that can then be configured manually to add more categories.</p>

<p>In the top bar, the "+" icon can be used to create a new file.  When a
single file is selected, it will instead show an "i" icon, used to show file
details (path, modified time and size).</p>

<p>The three-dots icon shows a menu whose commands vary depending on how many
files are currently selected.  There are commands that can copy a file to or
from an external folder, make a local copy of a file, rename a file, or delete
a file.</p>

<p>Selecting "Sample Files" from the hamburger (three lines) menu on the left
shows a list of available samples.  A double tap/click or a long press/click
will open a sample.  If the sample is edited, a modified copy will show up in
the app's working storage folder.</p>

<p>Once a file is opened, the "Close File" command in the menu will return to
the file list.</p>

<a id="netfiles"></a> <h2>Network Files</h2>

<p>TreeTag can interface with a Kinto storage server to access files from
multiple devices or locations.  You can either install and run your own server
or choose a low-cost cloud provider.</p>

<p>The server information is entered under the Settings item in the hamburger
menu. The Network Address is set to the full URL of a specific bucket object
on a Kinto server.  The Network User Name must also be set.  Setting the
Network Password item is optional.  If not set (the more secure option),
TreeTag will prompt you for the password once per session.</p>

<p>Use the Local and Network Storage items in the hamburger menu to switch
between network and local storage.  The file list and commands work basically
the same way under both.  The upload and download commands can be used to copy
a file from one storage area to the other.  Note that only JSON files, such as
TreeTag and TreeLine file formats, can be stored in the network.</p>

<a id="treeview"></a> <h2>Tree View</h2>

<p>In the tree view, title and grouping nodes are proceeded by small
triangles. These nodes can be tapped/clicked to expand or collapse the node's
children. The leaf nodes, proceeded by circles, contain the data.  They have
no children but they can be tapped/clicked to toggle between showing a single
title line (the default) or multiple output lines.</p>

<p>A long press/click on a tree node will show a detail view listing that
node's children (for title and grouping nodes) or the node output (for a leaf
node). On wide screens/windows (generally on desktops or tablets), the detail
view is shown to the right of the tree view.  Otherwise it temporarily covers
the tree view.  The detail view is described in the next section.  The tree
view will highlight current parent or node in the detail view.</p>

<p>The "+" icon in the top bar will create a new leaf node and show it in an
edit view. Once the editing is complete, the new node will be properly placed
into the tree.  In many cases, it's easier to start new nodes when the detail
view is showing a group or leaf node, since at least some of the fields will
initially be populated to match the group or leaf.</p>

<p>The magnifying glass icon will show a search view for finding matching leaf
nodes.  If the detail view is showing a grouping node, search results will be
limited to the children of that group.  If the detail view is showing a title
node or no node, all leaf nodes will be searched.  Note that searching is not
available if a leaf node is being shown.  The search view menu can be used to
set the search method to a phrase, keywords or regular expressions.  Note that
only regular expressions are case sensitive.  As a string is typed in the top
bar, matching nodes will be shown in the main view. Tapping/clicking on a
resulting node will select it and show its full output, with the matching text
highlighted.  The last node selected when leaving the search view will become
current in the detail view and expanded in the tree.  There is also a replace
option in the menu when searching by phrase or regular expression.  When
searching with regular expressions, adding "$1", "$2", etc. in the replacement
string will substitute matching groups from the search results.</p>

<p>The hamburger (three lines) menu includes commands for the configuration
editor, the settings view and the undo list, all described in subsequent
sections.  There is also a command to merge the data from a second file.  The
second file should have similar fields, but any missing fields will be added as
necessary.  Otherwise, the configuration of the current file is kept.  Finally,
there are commands to export the current data to a TreeLine file, to a CSV file
or to an indented text file.  The CSV export gives options for field text to be
as output (same as displayed) or as stored (better for re-import).  The
indented text export gives options to include titles only or all node output
lines.</p>

<a id="detailview"></a> <h2>Detail View</h2>

<p>If started from a title or grouping node, the detail view shows a list of
that node's children.  Child title or grouping nodes show the same line of
text as is shown in the tree view.  Child leaf nodes show the lines that are
configured in the output configuration.</p>

<p>Tapping/clicking on a child title or grouping node will show a new detail
view with that node's children.  Tapping/clicking on a child leaf node will
show a new detail view with that node by itself.  Tapping/clicking the left
arrow above the view will return to the previous view.</p>

<p>Tapping/clicking the "+" icon will create a new leaf node and show it in an
edit view. If started from a view of a grouping node or a leaf node, at least
some of the fields will initially be populated to match the group or leaf.</p>

<p>A detail view showing the children of a title node or a grouping node will
have a three-dots menu.  This menu includes commands to edit or delete all
descendant leaf nodes.  The edit command will show an edit view filled with
data that is common to all nodes.  The edits from adding or changing any
fields will be applied to all of the nodes.  The delete command will remove
all of the descendant leaf nodes.  Deleting with a title node as the current
parent will remove all leaf nodes from the file.</p>

<p>A detail view with an isolated leaf node will show edit (pencil icon) and
delete (trash icon) commands.  The edit command will show an edit view for
this leaf node. The delete command will remove all instances of this leaf
node.</p>

<p>Also, text can be selected and copied from an isolated leaf node in a
detail view.</p>

<a id="configfields"></a> <h2>Configure Fields</h2>

<p>The Fields tab of the Configuration view lists the fields that are defined
for leaf node data.  Tapping/clicking a field name toggles its selection.
There are icons above the list to create a new field ("+"), edit a field
(pencil), delete a field (trashcan), or move a field up or down (arrows).</p>

<p>Editing a new or existing field shows a form with the field name, type,
initial value, and default prefix and suffix.  When done editing, use the
left arrow at the top to finish editing.  There is also a reset button on the
upper right to restore previous settings.</p>

<p>The available field types include Text, LongText, Choice, AutoChoice,
Number, Date and Time.  The default type is Text.  LongText is the same except
for showing more lines in the edit view.  The AutoChoice type allows prior
values for the field to be selected from a pull-down menu, or a new value can
be typed.</p>

<p>The Choice, Number, Date and Time types add a field format definition
editor to the configuration edit form.  Tapping on the format will show an
edit view with oval chips for each segment of the format.  The chips can be
tapped/clicked to select them, and can be edited using the icons above the
chips.  The Number, Date and Time types show a format sample preview below the
chips that formats an arbitrary value.</p>

<a id="configtree"></a> <h2>Configure the Tree</h2>

<p>The Tree tab of the Configuration view shows how the title and grouping
nodes are arranged in the tree.  Tapping/clicking a node name toggles its
selection. There are icons above the tree to create a new node ("+"), edit a
node (pencil), delete a node (trashcan), or move a title node up or down
(arrows).  The new node button shows a menu for adding a title node as a
sibling or child of the selected node, or for adding a group node as a child.
The delete a node button shows a menu for deleting just the node or deleting
the node along with its children.</p>

<p>Title nodes function as static headings in the tree.  They form a scaffold
that organizes and arranges the grouping nodes.  The top level of the
structure must consist only of title node(s).  When adding and editing title
nodes, a dialog box prompts for the title text.  Deleting a title with the
node only option will move any child nodes up by one level.</p>

<p>Grouping nodes contain rules that categorize the leaf nodes into groups.
The rules consist of a field, sometimes combined with other fields or extra
text. In the main tree view, the data from each leaf node is used to fill in
the fields, and the resulting text strings become headings.  Leaf nodes that
match are placed under that heading.  Group nodes can be nested to further
subdivide the leaf nodes, but they cannot have any siblings and cannot have
title nodes as children.  Adding a new child title or group when there is an
existing group node will move the existing group down by one level.</p>

<p>Nested group nodes can also contain the same field as their parent but with
a different field format.  For example, a group node with a date field could
have a field format showing only the year, and a nested group could have a
field format showing months as lower level headings.</p>

<p>Adding a new group node shows a rule line editor.  Fields and text that are
added show up as oval chips for each segment of the rule.  These chips can be
edited, deleted and moved to define the rule.  Editing a field chip allows the
user to define a custom prefix and suffix, as well as a field format for
applicable field types.  If not explicitly set, these will use the field
defaults.  Once the rule line contains at least one field, the line editor can
be exited by using the left arrow at the top. Then a summary view for the
group node will be shown.</p>

<p>The summary view for the group node is also shown when editing an existing
group node. Tapping the rule definition at the top will start the rule line
editor described above.  Group sorting settings are shown below the rule
definition. This defines how the group's headings are sorted.  The default
sorts using the fields from the rule line in ascending order.  The custom
button can be used to define other sequences.  Finally, if the group node has
no nested child groups, child sorting settings are shown below the group sort
settings.  This defines how the child leaf nodes are sorted.  The default
sorts using all of the fields in ascending order.  The custom button can be
used to define other sequences.</p>

<a id="configoutput"></a> <h2>Configure Output</h2>

<p>The Output tab of the Configuration view shows a title line followed by one
or more output lines.  The title line defines how a leaf node is shown as a
single line in the main tree view.  The output lines are combined to define
how a leaf node is shown when expanded in the main tree view and in the detail
view.</p>

<p>Tapping/clicking a title or output line toggles its selection.  There are
icons above the lines to add a new output line ("+"), edit a line (pencil),
delete an output line (trashcan), or move an output line up or down.</p>

<p>Adding or editing a line shows the line editor.  Fields and text that are
added show up as oval chips for each segment of the line.  These chips can be
edited, deleted and moved to fully define the line.  Editing a field chip
allows the user to define a custom prefix and suffix, as well as a field
format for applicable field types.  If not explicitly set, these will use the
field defaults.  Once the line is not empty, the line editor can be exited by
using the left arrow at the top.</p>

<a id="configoptions"></a> <h2>Configure Options</h2>

<p>The Options tab of the Configuration view shows an option to enable
Markdown text formatting.  If enabled, text entries with Markdown syntax will
show formatted text in the Tree and Detail Views.  Many guides to Markdown
syntax are available on the web.  TreeTag specifically supports the GitHub
Flavored Markdown version.  Clickable links to http and https addresses can be
entered with the link text enclosed in square brackets followed by the address
in parenthesis.</p>

<p>On desktop platforms, right-clicking on field text editors when Markdown is
enabled will show a command to add a file link.  This will show a file select
dialog box to select the link target.  Clicking on that link in the formatted
tree or detail views opens the default application for that file type.  An
option in the Options tab is used to toggle between absolute and relative
paths for new links.</p>

<a id="undoview"></a> <h2>Undo View</h2>

<p>Undo operations can be essential because TreeTag is continually writing
changes to the file.  The undo list is also stored in the file.  It contains
all undo operations that have not been explicitly deleted by the user.  The
undo items are listed from oldest to newest.</p>

<p>To undo some operations, select "Undo to here" from the three-dots menu on
the earliest (highest) item to be undone.  That item and the lower, newer
items will change color to indicate that they have been selected.  Exiting the
view using the left arrow at the top will complete the undo operation.  The
undo can be aborted by selecting "Cancel undo" on the earliest item set to be
undone.</p>

<p>Once operations are undone, they are automatically converted to redo
operations. They can be redone the same as undo operations, by selecting "Undo
to here".  An exception is if undo operations prior to the redo operations are
also selected to be completed.  In this case the redo operations will become
gray to indicate that they will be removed to allow the older undo operations
to be completed.</p>

<p>Undo operations can be removed to keep the list manageable and to reduce
the size of the TreeTag data file.  To remove old undo operations, select
"Delete to here" from the three-dots menu on the most recent (lowest) item to
be removed. That item and the higher, older items will become gray to indicate
that they have been marked for deletion.  The deletion can be aborted by
selecting "Cancel delete" on the most recent item set to be removed.  Exiting
the view using the left arrow at the top will complete the deletion.  Once
completed, deleted items cannot be recovered.</p>

<p>In TreeTag Settings, there is an option for the Days to Store Undo History.
Undo operations older than this many days are not written to files.  This does
not remove undos currently in a session - it only affects what is written.  So
undo operations from the most recent changes will always be available, even if
older than this setting.  They only disappear after more changes are made
(written to a file), and then the file is closed.  Setting the number of days
to 0 will prevent all undo operations from being written to files.  Setting it
to a very large number will effectively prevent undos from being automatically
removed.</p>

<a id="settingsview"></a> <h2>Settings View</h2>

<p>The settings view contains general customization options.  Options not
previously discussed include hiding dot files, enabling spell checks, tight
line spacing, a dark theme, remember window geometry and a view scale ratio.
File names that begin with a dot will not be shown if the hidden option is
enabled.  The red underline under misspelled English words is controlled by the
spell check setting (currently, no suggestions are shown for misspelled words
on desktop platforms). The tight line spacing option allows more lines to fit
on the screen - it is recommended when using a mouse, but may not leave enough
space for touch interfaces.  A darker theme can be enabled in place of the
default light theme.  The window size and position will be restored from the
previous session use if enabled.  The view scale ratio can be set to make the
content smaller or larger (useful for high-dpi displays).</p>

<p>On desktop platforms, there is also an option to set the working directory.
This is where all files in the main file list are stored.</p>
