<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li>TreeTag and its developer take your privacy very seriously.</li>
<li>By default, all data that users input is stored locally, on the user's own
device. </li>
<li>To remotely store data, users may optionally select a third-party Kinto
server and enter the server's address in TreeTag's settings.  In this case, the
user is responsible for evaluating the security and privacy policies of the
third party server. </li>
<li>TreeTag uses no third-party analytics or advertising frameworks. </li>
<li>If you email the developer for support or other feedback, the emails will be
retained for quality assurance purposes.  The email addresses will be used only
to reply to the concerns or suggestions raised and will never be used for any
other purpose. </li>
<li>Other than as noted above, TreeTag does not collect, transmit, distribute or
sell your data. </li>
